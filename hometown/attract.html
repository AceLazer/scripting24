		<h1>Attractions</h1>
	
	There are many attractions at Lethbridge. One of the more well-known ones is Fort Whoop-Up, which is an older trading fort from the earlier days of Lethbridge’s history. There, you can learn more about the trading that happened there and many other stories. If you want to learn even more about the history of this city, you can also go to the Galt Museum, where there are a variety of exhibits, such as the “Soar! A History of Gliding in Southwestern Alberta,” and the “Swing! Music of the Home Front” exhibit. Another area of interest in Lethbridge is the Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden, where you can walk around the beautiful gardens with the 16th-century inspired tea pavilion and calming water around. There is informative sections of this park as well that speak of it’s history and stories. For more art oriented people, there is the SAAG, also known as the Southern Alberta Art Gallery and CASA, which have ongoing displays of art and even workshops.
