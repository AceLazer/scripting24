		<h1>Economy</h1>
	
	Lethbridge’s economy has traditionally been based on agriculture, especially in potatoes, canola, and sugar beets. The livestock industry is also a part of Alberta’s and Lethbridge’s economy. Manufacturing takes up about 10 percent of the total economy for the city, and accounts for more than 1.2 billion dollars in sales annually, in areas such as furniture, machining, foods and beverages, and construction materials, just to name a few. Health care is also a vital industry in Lethbridge since the Chinook Health, the local health region is based here. Over 3,000 health care and medical staff are hired from Lethbridge, including around 200 physicians. There are also retail businesses such as Bath & Body Works, Chapters, EB Games, Old Navy, Pandora, and Sport Chek, among many others that are situated in the Park Place Mall. There are also other smaller malls such as the Centre Village Mall and West Village Mall. Other businesses in Lethbridge are Safeway, Walmart, Tim Hortons, Boston Pizza, No Frills, Little Caesars and Pizza Hut.
