		<h1>Geography</h1>
	
	The city of Lethbridge has a varied landscape. In many areas, such as near the Oldman River, the coulees can be seen. You can go down Whoop Up Drive and see the rolling hills and the High-Level Bridge connecting them. The valley of the Oldman River is 755 hectares of protected land, making it one of the largest urban park systems in North America. There are also residential areas that have straight streets with trees growing on the sides, making for a beautiful walk through, or others that are in the valley, such as the Paradise Canyon area. There are also areas such as in West Lethbridge where the golden plains stay visible in sight past buildings near the residential areas and you can drive towards the Lethbridge County, seeing the wide-open spaces around you. When you visit Lethbridge, the warm winds, and the sunlight will give you a chance to admire the different areas of the city, each with their own charm and appeal.
