	Lethbridge is a city that has some of the conveniences of a larger city while having the familiarity and feeling of a smaller town. From the golden plains on the outskirts of the town, to the busier downtown and industrial areas, there is a lot of variety of what you can see around you.  This Southern Alberta city is known for itâ€™s High Level Bridge and winds. It is also known for its warmer climate due to the warm chinooks that blow in and sunlight.  The City of Lethbridge officially became a city on the year 1906, on May 9th. Unlike other cities of its size, Lethbridge has two post-secondary institutions which are the Lethbridge College and the University of Lethbridge. It is also the largest municipal government south of Calgary and there are many provincial government agencies, such as the Executive Council of Alberta, that are based here in Lethbridge.
