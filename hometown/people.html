		<h1>People</h1>
	
	The population of Lethbridge had passed 100,000 people in 2019 with a recorded number of 101,482 residents, but its current population is 117,394. The feeling of closeness as a community is truly visible wherever you are in the city. You could visit the grocery store and get good service from kind people and go to a different area of the city and get that same warm and heartfelt feeling from people. People can be very helpful, whether they are business owners or someone that you pass on the street, and most tend to be friendly and treat you like you are part of the community. The community is in many ways united, while being very diverse. There are many different cultural communities from Italian and Filipino, to Hispanic/Latino and Nepali. There are cultural centres scattered throughout the city, and many different events and programs in place that celebrate each culture and their history.
